    <p>
        My name is <mark><strong>Akapelly</strong></mark> and I'm currently I'd say a semi-frontend developer, I love whatever it is that I love and I use my freetime mostly to emphasize on coding...

            I started playing football at the age of 9 as a local player but got to take it semi-professional in 2016
            while I was 13.I schooled at <abbr title="All Saints primary school">ASPS</abbr> Onitsha Anambra state from
            age 7 till age 12.
            In 2015, towards the november period, I got enrolled to <abbr
                title="Government Technical College">GTC</abbr> and I had to go through my junior secondary education as
            a student of this school.

        I eventually had my <abbr title="Basic Education Certificate Examinations">BECE</abbr> in 2018 after many controversies, many ups and countless downs; Hardships I faced in school:
        <ul>
            <li>Inability to pay school fees</li>
            <li>Trekking about 5km to school(even tho It wasn't most of the times)</li>
            <li>Getting bullied{although I took advantage of that and got to learn how to stand up for myself} </li>
        </ul><!--this wasn't neccessary actually but I gotta do what I gotta do-->
