                    The 3 Million Technical Talent (3MTT) programme, a critical part of
                    the Renewed Hope agenda, is aimed at building Nigeria's technical
                    talent backbone to power our digital economy and position Nigeria as a
                    net talent exporter. The first phase of the programme, executed in
                    collaboration with NITDA, will involve multiple stakeholders including
                    fellows, training providers, partners and placement organisations.
