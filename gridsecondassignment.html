                I received a job offer mid-course,and the subjects I learnt were current, if not more so,in the company
                I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                have had some people who had an amazing experience here.I signed up for the free intro and found it
                incredibly fun!. I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a software engineer at a VR startup."

                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful thuibngs about the program.The entire curriculumn and staff
                did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.The agile team
                project,in particular,was outstanding.It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                could ever have.In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
                experience.It certainly helped land me a job as a full-stack developer after receiving many offers.100%
                recommend!"
